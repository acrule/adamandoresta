                  <h4>Hi, we're the Rules</h4>
                  <p> Yep, its a pretty great last name! After meeting in the sunshine of San Diego we now call the lush green of Portland, Oregon home. We both work at <a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/">Oregon Health & Science University</a> and <a href="http://www.gobytram.com/">ride a gondola</a> to work. When not "on the hill" we are usually biking around town, enjoying one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Park_(Portland,_Oregon)">local parks</a>, or generally exploring the great Northwest. Other hobbies include running, climbing, backpacking, and complaining about the rain (though New York, Chicago, DC, and our constant rival Seattle all get more rain than Portland). </p>

                  <h4>About Adam<small> by Oresta</small></h4>
                  <p>Adam is a post-doctoral scholar at Oregon Health & Science University working in human-computer interaction and medical informatics. When not crunching data on how clinicians use electronic medical records or thinking really hard, he enjoys running, surfing, and ultra-light backpacking. Adam has a heart for the local church and enjoys working with international students. He also has a passion for donuts and spends many a weekend searching for the best apple fritter in town.  More on his academic pursuits on <a href="https://adamrule.com">his personal website</a>.</p>

                  <h4>About Oresta<small> by Adam</small></h4>
                  <p>Oresta is a resident in pediatrics at Oregon Health & Science University with a passion for underserved medicine. When not taking care of patients, you can find Oresta in one of Portland's many parks or even more numerous coffee shops. She loves the outdoors, has a bitter feud with all things cold (except ice cream), and likes to "meow" at cats, some of which meow back. Oresta is also an accomplished painter. You can find more on her residency program and fellow residents on <a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/health/services/doernbecher/research-education/education/pediatric-residency-program/about/meet-our-residents.cfm">OHSU's website</a>.</p>
