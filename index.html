                  <h3>About Adam<small> by Oresta</small></h3>
                  <p>Adam Rule is a PhD candidate at UC San Diego working in human-computer interaction, developing tools to help people to do deep work. When he’s not hacking away or thinking really hard, he enjoys climbing, surfing, and ultra-lightweight backpacking. Adam has a heart for the local church and produces music for the Sunday worship bands. He also has a passion for donuts and can be frequently spotted in his natural habitat—Rose Donuts—savoring a buttermilk bar.</p>

                  <h3>About Oresta<small> by Adam</small></h3>
                  <p>Oresta Tolmach is a medical student at UC San Diego with a passion for underserved medicine. When not studying or taking care of patients, you can find Oresta in the climbing gym, at one of San Diego's many parks, or teaching the little ones at The Resolved Church. She loves the outdoors, has a bitter fued with all things cold (except ice cream), and likes to "meow" at cats, some of which meow back.</p>

                  <h3>About Adam & Oresta<small> by Us</small></h3>
                  <p>We met at church and went to see Cuarteto Quiroga, a Spanish string quartet, for our first date. Since Oresta played violin in high school and studied abroad in Spain, this went over well. We've spent much of the last year rock climbing, reading books aloud, and falling in love. Adam asked Oresta to marry him while on a picnic in a eucalyptus grove overlooking La Jolla Cove. She said yes.</p>

                  <h3>Exploring Eugene</h3>
                  <p>Eugene is <a href="http://www.gotracktownusa.com/" target="_newtab">Track Town USA</a>, home to the <a href="http://uoregon.edu/" target="_newtab">University of Oregon</a>, and situated in the lush Willamette River Valley. Some of our favorite activities around town including <a href="files/bike_trail.pdf" target="_newtab">biking along the Willamette</a>, hiking <a href="files/spencer.pdf" target="_newtab">Spencer Butte</a>, visiting the <a href="https://www.kingestate.com/" target="_newtab">King Estate Winery</a>, and enjoying <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/voodoo-doughnut-eugene-2" target="_newtab">Voodoo Donuts</a>.</p>
                  <p>Many of the <a href="http://traveloregon.com/7wonders/" target="_newtab">7 Wonders of Oregon</a> including Mt Hood, Crater Lake, the Oregon Coast, and the Columbia River Gorge are just a few hours drive away. Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, and Vancouver Island are all just a short flight away. Why not come for the wedding and stay for the Northwest?</p>
                  <p>We are currently looking into reserving a block of rooms at a hotel in Eugene for Saturday and Sunday nights (6/3 - 6/5). Stay tuned! In the meantime, you might try <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/Eugene--OR" target="_newtab">Airbnb</a> or <a href="https://www.vrbo.com/vacation-rentals/usa/oregon/willamette-valley/eugene" target="_newtab">VRBO</a>. </p>

                  <h3>Gifts & Registry</h3>
                  <p>The most meaningful gift you can give us on our wedding day is your presence. We hate to ask for things (we already have plenty!) but we realize many of you may wish to mark our marriage with a gift. We would be honored if you selected an item from our Amazon registry or gave  in our honor to <a href="https://www.servantchurchsd.org/" target="_newtab">Servant Church</a>, a church planted out of our own church last year to serve the Barrio Logan neighborhood in San Diego.</p>
